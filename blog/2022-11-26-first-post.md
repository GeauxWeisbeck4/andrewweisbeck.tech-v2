# Welcome to Andrew Weisbeck Tech Docs Version 2!

Many of you may not have seen version one because it wasn't available for too long before Docusaurus 2 came out - I had to update it to the next version. The only problem with that is I lost all of the good content when I got my iMac back from the pawn shop and it's memory was corrupted...

IT SUCKS!

But here I am with a fresh new slate and a brand new documentation website! You will find the documentation for many of my projects on this website, as well as some notes that I feel accomodate this documentation website quite well. I will typically create separate websites for each notes topic because there is a lot of work that goes into my notes.

## Contact me with questions or anything else

You can reach out to me if you have any questions on how something was implemented or if you want to work with me or hire me. You can fill out the form avaialable on the website or message me any of the other ways I have listed on this website. I am more than happy to speak with you about my creations, so don't be shy!

## Donations & More

I have linked my information that allow you to donate to my cause (open source work) and help support me as a full stack web developer. Any amount is appreciated, but I also offer content and other services for those who want to receive something direct from their payments to me. Donations are appreciated, but I would rather you purchase one of my services! But if you really feel like helping me out and donating to my websites, I will at least send you a really rad card.

## Thank you for visiting and check in for updates!

I am constantly developing something, so always check back in to see what I have been up to. Follow me on Twitter (@GeauxWeisbeck4) and I will share my Mastadon before too long.

Oh and Happy Late Thanksgiving :)
